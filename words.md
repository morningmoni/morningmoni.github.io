## Love

Don't try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to

Love is selfish. It's to stay connected with one's self in the presence of another.

You are static in my mind, existing there till I terminate.

Tried to let go. Almost succeeded

the problems of ur past r ur biz. ur future is my privilege

never frown, even when you are sad, cuz u never know who is falling in love with ur smile.

Some people try to find the right one, while some try to be.

我渴望能见你一面，但请你记得，我不会开口要求见你。这不是因为骄傲，你知道我在你面前毫无骄傲可言，而是因为，唯有你也想见我的时候，我们见面才有意义。——西蒙娜·德·波伏娃《越洋情书》

我一直爱你，偶尔喜欢别人，在她们像你的时候

远远看去优美而神秘的人和事，只要拉近了看，就明白原来他们既不神秘也不优美。——《追忆似水年华》

I am too cautious to start a wrong relationship. I am too surreal to be real.

I don't really see much of anything. But I see you. That is crazy.

I am so sensitive that I act more like TCP than UDP in love.

I'm a vessel, filled with others' soul.

If fate is linear time-invariant, then a time shifting may help.

Are you an exception? Let me catch you.



I'm a virus in the air. I'm looking for some host. So don't get too close, or you may get cough.

I'm a virus in the air. I'm innocuous for the time. But heed what's happening, in case I wake up in the morning.

I'm a virus in the air. I'm pacific in the wind, but seemingly not in your flesh. You shall get thirsty, thrilled, twisted. You shall rip your vessels and crush your heart. You shall deify the illusion in your mind. You shall crawl on the ground for whole day long. 

So don't come. You never ever did, and never ever will.



Time goes by, even faster than I.

Days elapse, just too late to say bye.

You passed by, like a passer-by,

I just could not say hi.



Dear Madam,

Thank you for expressing your interest in offering me a place as a boyfriend. However, due to the large amount of love confessions I received this year, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your confession at this time.

Please be aware that this rejection does not reflect any negative evaluation on your confession. This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of love confessions. With such a varied and promising result, it is impossible for me to accept all confessions, regardless of their outstanding confessing performances.

Again, I greatly appreciate your interest in loving me, and I offer my best wishes of success in your future love confession.

Best,

Dean of Love Confession Acceptance and Financial Aid

她明明已经很好了，可是她还要变得更好。

她有很好的学历，很好的样貌，很不错的工作，可是她出去玩，她看电影，她吃美食，她拍了好看的照片却从不发朋友圈炫耀。

她背着包手里还拎着袋子，同行的男生要帮她，说不用我自己可以。

她每天晚上看书，工作，写论文，她受到匿名的礼物，只是自己收好，不会发朋友圈配上图再假装无辜的问一句，这是谁干的？

**你这么低调，可是我为什么这么没有安全感？**

**因为我害怕，每一个真正接触过你的人，都会爱上你。**



## Encouraging

Chance favors the prepared mind & Fortune favors the bold

你必须非常努力才能看起来毫不费力

当你的才华还撑不起你的野心的时候，你就应该静下心来学习。

不要让你的性格驾驭了你的能力

I am the master of my fate and the captain of my soul

If you are still looking for that one person who will change your life, take a look in the mirror.

There are doubts in my mind, then bleach me; There are shadows in my heart, then light me; **You are a monster. You fight and never die.**

Death never stops to rest. Neither can we.

it's impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do.

后来许多人问我一个人夜晚踟蹰路上的心情，我想起的却不是孤单和路长，而是波澜壮阔的海和天空中闪耀的星光 《走吧张小砚》

## Badass

I know who I am, but you don't know who you are.

have no fear of perfect. u'll never reach it

Someday, someone will best me. But it won't be today, and it won't be you. 

The only thing you should know is that you know nothing.



## **Code**

一段感情能给你带来多少酸楚，就曾给你带来多少幸福;一段代码曾给你带来多少痛苦，就能给你带来多少满足

写代码易，调试不易，且行且珍惜。

代码未动，算法先行

想要实例化的时候，却还都是抽象类

设想很美好，deadline太早



## **Random**

everyone is changing everyday, in every possible way

The guy, dead before getting shot in the head, told a lie for a rest.

Our consciousness creates the present, just as it creates the past, from many distributed clues scattered in our mind.

Every soil where he is well, is to a valiand man his natural country.

尘缘尘梦尘虞泪，缘深缘浅缘是罪。若水若云若魂飞，梦痴梦醒梦千回。

from womb to tomb, we are bound to others, past and present.

“从未年轻过的人，一定无法体会这个世界 的偏见。我们被世俗拆散，也要为爱情勇往直前；我们被房价羞辱，也要让简陋的现实变的温暖；我们被权威漠视，也要为自己的天分保持骄傲；我们被平庸折磨， 也要开始说走就走的冒险。所谓的光辉 月，并不是后来闪耀的日子，而是无人问津时，你对梦想的偏执，你是否有勇气， 对自己忠诚到底，我是陈欧，我为自己代言。”

唯有黑暗，带来光明

弱小和无知不是生存的障碍，傲慢才是

上院初，下院暮，仰思百年菁菁路，留园玉兰顾；江川渡，剑川宿，樱花蓁蓁怡情驻，饮水思源处。

Mystery is not about travelling, but looking with new eyes. Philosophy is not to learn, but to feel.

what makes a real man fake, himself or the world?

nothing is as beautiful as an elegant equation translated into a perfect engineering

Honey thats not funny. Too awkward to move forward.

no hope no dupe

believe betray beseech

forever forsake forgive forget

遗忘需要功

往事不可追 来世不可待 过去已过去 未来尚未来

footloose and fancyfree

lolls around on the ground

take ur time to tell a lie

no rest no mercy no matter what

如果发出声音是危险的，那就保持沉默；如果自觉无力发光，那就别去照亮别人。但是，不要习惯了黑暗就为黑暗辩护；不要为自己的苟且而得意洋洋；不要嘲讽那些比自己更勇敢、更有热量的人们。可以卑微如尘土，不可扭曲如蛆虫。

轻誉苟毁，好憎尚怒，小人哉

有人说你变了，也许你只是没有按照他的想法来活。

彼苍者天，曷其有极。彼茫者烟，曷其有隙。
